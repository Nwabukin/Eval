# Tool Usage & Development Workflow

## Version & Documentation Lookup

- **Before installing ANY package**: use `WebSearch` to confirm the latest LTS/stable version — never assume versions
- **For framework API usage**: use Context7 MCP (`resolve-library-id` → `query-docs`) to get up-to-date NestJS, Next.js, and library documentation before writing code
- **Runtime**: target Node.js LTS (currently 22.x); confirm with WebSearch if uncertain

## Code Quality Gates

- **After every substantive edit**: run `ReadLints` on the modified files — fix introduced errors immediately
- **After creating/modifying a module**: run the TypeScript compiler check via Shell (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- **After writing tests**: run them via Shell (`npm test -- --filter <module>`) and verify pass before moving on

## Search & Exploration

- **Finding code by meaning** (how does auth work?): use `SemanticSearch`
- **Finding exact symbols/strings** (where is `EvaluationStatus` defined?): use `Grep`
- **Finding files by name pattern**: use `Glob`
- **Broad codebase exploration**: use `Task` subagent with `explore` type
- Never use Shell for `cat`, `grep`, `find`, `head`, `tail` — always use the dedicated tools

## Browser & Frontend Testing

- Use the browser MCP tools (`browser_navigate` → `browser_lock` → interact → `browser_unlock`) to verify UI changes
- Take snapshots with `browser_snapshot` before interacting with elements
- For longer test flows, use the `browser-use` subagent

## Git & Commits

- Commit working code frequently in small, focused chunks
- Format: `<type>: <description>` — types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`
- Each commit must build and pass linting — never commit broken code
- Always verify with `git status` and `git diff` before committing

## Task Management

- Use `TodoWrite` for any task with 3+ steps to track progress
- Mark tasks `in_progress` → `completed` as you work — only one in-progress at a time
- Break large features into module-level subtasks

## File Operations

- **Read**: use `Read` tool — never `cat` or `head`
- **Edit**: use `StrReplace` — never `sed` or `awk`
- **Create**: use `Write` — never `echo >` or heredoc
- **Delete**: use `Delete` tool
